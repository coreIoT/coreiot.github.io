<p>In the keynote of CES 2016, presentation by Ginni Rometty, CEO of IBM. She mentioned a remarkable statement about how to bring your company to be differentiated from other company in the IoT business, which is to be able to understand the data collected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe the most disruptive, transformative trend is now in front of us, and it's cognitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cognitive by here meant that, the ability to think, to learn to understand the systems, the products, the processes everything you do.</p>

<h4 id="driversforthetechnologyera">Drivers for the Technology Era</h4>

<p>In the highlighted video, she mentioned there will be a few drivers for the technology era. First, the data was invisible in the past will now be visible to you. I believe what she mentioned here could be all the data collected from device sensors. All of these data were raw and meaningless by its own. This is why she move on to the second driver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>80 percent of the data out there ... it's black, it's invisible, it's not understood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second driver is the advent of cognitive computing. Which she also did mentioned it is an artificial intelligence. Take an example from IBM Watson, is a remarkable AI that once beat all the contestants in the TV Show, Jeopardy! This makes sense that, with the second drive, a cognitive computing, it can help to make sense of the raw data collected from sensors into meaningful insights, and these data are valuable. Another important point she did mentioned that, with these computing power, because of its ability to understand, reason and learn. This created an era of systems you doesn't need to program. To me it really sounds cool.</p>

<h4 id="practicalofcognitiveiot">Practical of Cognitive IoT</h4>

<p>In the highlight video, there's a part where Ginni mentioned about the practical of Cognitive IoT which I think very essential. Which the use case with in aircraft. Just as she mentioned, with six million sensors in an airplane from 3000 suppliers. Imagine that, with just a single flight is enough to provides you billion bytes (GB) or more. As in IoT, we talk about processing in second, how many could you handle the other flights in your analytics? Two? Three? What if it is an airport? That is really crazy. But if you could handle that, you bring values into your company, for example you can predict the time of failure, predict maintenance in advance for each aircraft. With each maintenance, you drives revenues.</p>

<h4 id="criticalsuccessfactorswithcognitiveiot">Critical Success Factors with Cognitive IoT</h4>

<p>As conclusion, from the cognitive IoT, Ginni mentioned there are three critical success factors with Cognitive IoT. First is the right platform. Here she meant a platform that able to deploy application from your build, take example with <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/" target="_blank">Bluemix</a>, which works well with Watson APIs that allow you to implement "cognition" in your build. Second is the new form of data. She mentioned that in the services, they able to bring data that we don't possess, but might be useful to us. In the video she also did mentioned the example form of data is weather data and some sort of video data (this part is yet not clear to me, I think I will use their service to find out more myself). Lastly, is the Ecosystem. I believe for startup to be successful in IoT, it needs to be involved in the IoT Ecosystem created by those big players.
